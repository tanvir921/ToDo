This action follows the recent revelation of a high-profile scandal involving a former lawmaker and his questionable cryptocurrency transfers. South Korean legal authorities have conducted a thorough search of accounts at the country’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb. This action pertains to transfers carried out by ex-lawmaker Kim Nam-kuk on Monday. In addition, Kakao’s messaging application also fell under scrutiny as Kim reportedly used its Klip cryptocurrency wallet for transactions, as reported by CoinDesk Korea. Since the previous week, Rep. Kim Nam-kuk, associated with the Democratic Party of Korea, has found himself tangled in allegations of conflict of interest. These accusations stem from cryptocurrency withdrawals he made in 2022, raising questions about the appropriateness of his actions. Kim is also under scrutiny for allegations that he engaged in cryptocurrency trading during the National Assembly’s judiciary committee meetings in May and November of the previous year, according to a report by CoinDesk Korea. Despite portraying himself as a modest politician, it was discovered that he owned 800,000 WEMIX tokens, valued at 6 billion won ($4.5 million), during the months of January and February 2022. Kim Nam-kuk stepped down from the Minjoo party on Sunday, following revelations that surfaced over a week ago about his ownership of approximately $4.5 million in wemix coins during 2021. This information aligns with previous reports made by several news sources two years ago. At this point, it remains unclear whether Kim had any unfair advantage such as access to privileged information that might have assisted his investment decisions, or whether he was gifted free coins by virtue of his political stature. Korean prosecutors launched a search operation on Monday at Upbit and Bithumb, the platforms where Kim is purported to have his digital wallets, as part of their ongoing investigation into Kim’s affairs. The report suggests that transaction records were confiscated during these searches. This controversy has also triggered an in-house investigation by the ruling political party into Kim, following accusations of him engaging in cryptocurrency trades during parliamentary sessions. Throughout his political career, Kim supported regulatory legislation that would classify certain gaming revenues as cryptocurrencies. The unfolding of Kim’s crypto scandal coincides with South Korea’s ongoing efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.","pubDate":"2023-05-15 14:52:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"coinpedia","category":["top"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LOVESNOOPY’ Token Lists on MEXC Exchange","link":"https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/lovesnoopy-token-lists-on-mexc-exchange/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=lovesnoopy-token-lists-on-mexc-exchange","keywords":["News","Press release"],"creator":["Chainwire"],"video_url":null,"description":"Seattle, USA, May 15th, 2023, Chainwire The recent surge of meme coins in the cryptocurrency market is nothing short of a phenomena, as meme coins have taken center stage in the world of cryptocurrencies.

While the United States dollar controls more than 55 percent of global FX markets through the SWIFT platform, other countries led by Russia, China, and India are looking to break away from the dollar. In what has been described as de-dollarization, more countries are beginning to use their local currency in settling international trade. Furthermore, the United States Fed has been struggling to bring inflation down to the desired 2 percent due to the banking crisis. Additionally, the Fed has printed more dollars in the past three years than in the past few decades in the name of stimulus packages to aid Covid-19 struck businesses. Economists Forecast the Demise of the U.S Dollar According to Matthew Piepenburg, a partner at German-based Matterhorn Asset Management, in a recent YouTube interview with Deutsche Goldmesse, the rise of Gold and real money – insinuating deflationary digital money like Bitcoin – has accelerated the demise of the United States dollar. Furthermore, the United States Fed has been talking about raising its national debt ceiling amid rising inflation, thus adding to the burden of other countries holding the dollar as a reserve currency. Piepenburg stated; So when that dollar gets higher because Powell is raising the rates, that becomes more onerous and painful for the rest of the world and they begin to break ranks. Asia in general, China and Russia in particular are very big rank-breaking nations. And, of course, they’re bringing 41 other countries alongside to have trade settlements outside the US dollar, As a result, the economists unanimously agreed that the breakaway of global countries from the United States dollar is irrevocable. Currently, Russia and China are leading other top global economies including Brazil, India, and South Africa in developing a breakaway currency.

The clear trend of breaking ranks with the US dollar as a trusted, reliable, dependable trade currency and payment system is now I think irrevocable, In a recent BRICS’ update, nearly 19 more countries requested to join the organization that takes pride in a combined GDP of more than $26 trillion. Bitcoin To the World The Bitcoin market has been touted as real money with deflationary status amid mainstream adoption. Moreover, Bitcoin has been closely associated with Gold in its store of value characteristics. With a fixed supply of 21 million units, countries are beginning to adopt digital assets as a global reserve currency. Already, the United States government holds more than 220K Bitcoins seized from illicit activities. @import url(\"//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,700&subset=latin\");@media (min-width:300px){[data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262cb\"]{overflow:hidden;background-color:rgb(58,92,245) !important;border-radius:3px !important;padding:30px !important;--background-color:rgb(58,92,245)!important;--tve-applied-background-color:rgb(58,92,245)!important;}:not(#tve) [data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262cd\"]{font-family:Lato;font-weight:400;color:rgb(255,255,255) !important;font-size:53px !important;text-transform:none !important;}[data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d0\"]{margin:40px 0px 0px !important;background-image:none !important;--background-image:none!important;--tve-applied-background-image:none!important;padding-bottom:0px !important;}:not(#tve) [data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d1\"] input,:not(#tve) [data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d1\"] textarea,:not(#tve) [data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d1\"] ::placeholder{font-size:var(--tve-font-size,33px);text-align:center;}[data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d1\"]{--tve-font-size:33px;}[data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d2\"]{--tcb-local-color-cf6ff:var(--tcb-color-0)!important;--tcb-local-color-73c8d:rgb(225,120,45)!important;min-width:100%;}:not(#tve) [data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d2\"]:hover .tcb-button-link{background-color:var(--tcb-local-color-73c8d)!important;}[data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d2\"] .tcb-button-link{background-color:var(--tcb-local-color-cf6ff)!important;letter-spacing:2px;border-radius:5px;padding:18px 30px;}[data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d2\"] .tcb-button-link span{color:rgb(255,255,255);--tcb-applied-color:#fff;}:not(#tve) [data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d2\"] .tcb-button-link{line-height:1.2em;font-size:32px;}:not(#tve) [data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d4\"]{font-size:21px !important;color:rgb(146,136,136) !important;--tcb-applied-color:rgb(146,136,136)!important;--tve-applied-color:rgb(146,136,136)!important;}[data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d5\"]{color:rgb(255,255,255) !important;}[data-css=\"tve-u-185a0960607\"]{margin-bottom:-45px !important;}}@media (max-width:1023px){[data-css=\"tve-u-185a0960607\"]{margin-bottom:-45px !important;padding-bottom:0px !important;}}@media (max-width:767px){:not(#tve) [data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262cd\"]{font-size:30px !important;}[data-css=\"tve-u-185a09262d0\"]{margin-top:16px !important;}} .tve-leads-conversion-object .thrv_heading h1,.tve-leads-conversion-object .thrv_heading h2,.tve-leads-conversion-object .thrv_heading h3{margin:0;padding:0}.tve-leads-conversion-object .thrv_text_element p,.tve-leads-conversion-object .thrv_text_element h1,.tve-leads-conversion-object .thrv_text_element h2,.tve-leads-conversion-object .thrv_text_element h3{margin:0} Subscribe to our daily newsletter! >> Subscribe << No spam, no lies, only insights.

May 8 was the deadline for feedback on the SEC’s proposed custody rule, and there was feedback aplenty. Andreessen Horowitz’s general counsel Miles Jennings called the proposal a “misguided and transparent attempt to wage war on crypto.” The Blockchain Association claimed the rule exceeds the SEC’s authority, would inhibit advisers from transacting with crypto exchanges and leave investors’ assets at more risk. The chair of the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Representative Patrick McHenry, wrote that the SEC was exceeding its authority in the proposed rule, known as the registered investment adviser rule. Another reason for criticizing the SEC was its “legal threat” to Coinbase in late March, accusing it of “possible violations of securities laws.” The U.S.-headquartered crypto exchange filed a complaint, supported by a U.S. Chamber of Commerce amicus brief last week. The Chamber of Commerce threw its full weight behind Coinbase, accusing the SEC of deliberately creating a precarious and uncertain landscape for crypto companies operating in the country. Paradigm — the crypto investment firm led by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam — has also filed an amicus brief. According to the firm, regulatory uncertainty could lead to a “de facto ban on digital asset trading platforms” without a clear path to register with the SEC. Finally, watchdog group Empower Oversight Whistleblowers and Research (EMPOWR) has filed suit against the SEC to force it to comply with a Freedom of Information Act request for access to communications between former Commission officials and their former and future employers. EMPOWR claimed in its suit that the former SEC officials had a potential conflict of interest regarding cryptocurrency. The lawsuit specifically mentioned former SEC chair Jay Clayton, former enforcement division director Marc Berger and former director of corporate finance William Hinman. State legislators in Texas have voted to amend the state’s Bill of Rights by adding a provision recognizing the right of individuals to possess, retain and utilize digital currencies. Bill HJR 146 — introduced by State Representative Giovani Capriglione — declares that individuals have the right to use a medium of exchange that is mutually agreed upon, which includes digital currencies, cash, coin, bullion, or scrip, for trading and contracting goods and services, and that this right cannot be violated.

The court has accepted the proposed bail offer for Kwon and Terraform Labs chief financial officer Han Chang-Joon of 400,000 euros ($436,000) each. This is in addition to being put under house arrest instead of being taken into custody. According to the documents, if the house arrest is compromised, the bail will be entered into a “special section” of the court’s working budget. The current criminal trial in Montenegro is anticipated to start on June 16.

In court documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 8, Bankman-Fried’s legal team pushed to dismiss everything apart from three counts of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Bankman-Fried was initially extradited to the U.S. from the Bahamas to face eight criminal charges of alleged fraud and money laundering. However, his legal team argues that four of the five additional charges, which have since been added, “violates the Treaty’s rule of specialty provision.” Under the “rule of specialty,” the requesting state (the U.S.) is generally bound to trial the extradited offender only for the offense for which they were extradited.

He warns that the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will experience a significant decline due to economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the forecasted decline, investors can take advantage of the current market conditions by trading cryptocurrencies through the platform offering a $600 bonus for new traders. Raoul Pal, a well-known macro investor and founder of Real Vision, has predicted that an avalanche is coming for the cryptocurrency market. Pal suggests that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are about to experience a massive sell-off due to various reasons, including regulatory crackdowns and increasing concerns surrounding the environmental impact of mining. Pal believes that governments worldwide may begin to crack down on cryptocurrencies as they begin to pose a threat to traditional economy and monetary systems. In particular, he thinks that countries with weaker economies will face increasing pressure to ban or limit the use of cryptocurrencies in order to maintain their own currency stability. In addition, Pal notes the growing concern surrounding the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. Recently, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as a payment method, citing that Bitcoin mining requires a significant amount of energy and has a negative impact on the environment. This has sparked a wider conversation about the sustainability of cryptocurrencies and the need to find more eco-friendly alternatives. Pal’s prediction comes after a year of explosive growth for the cryptocurrency market, which has seen Bitcoin reaching all-time highs of over $60,000 in April 2021. However, this growth has also led to heightened volatility, with the cryptocurrency market experiencing significant swings in value over short periods. Despite the potential for an imminent sell-off, some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency market will eventually recover and continue to grow in the long term. They argue that cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly mainstream and that adoption will only continue to increase over time. In conclusion, Raoul Pal’s prediction of an avalanche coming for the cryptocurrency market should not be taken lightly. While cryptocurrencies remain volatile and subject to regulatory pressures, the long-term prospects for the industry remain strong. As with any investment, it is important for investors to do their own research and proceed with caution. So then when you’re seeking Clarity in this world and the world is actually the most simple it’s ever been money in Money out that’s it then what you want to do is earn the assets that rise the most and outperform that which happens to be crypto and technology so if we look at The last time we went through this point which is the turn in the cycle which is where we are today that was December 21st I think it was 2018 when the FED paused which is roughly where we’re getting to now the market already knows this it can see it coming we’re already Having a banking crisis you know all the signs of we need to stop and what happened after that over the next year is the s p Rose about 15 the NASDAQ Rose about 25 what I call the exponential age stocks they Rose about 35 40 and crypto Did well at one point three hundred percent but end of the year up about 100 which is truly extraordinary I’ve also then shown that crypto is all the same thing so if I use the same Global liquidity index it’s basically chart Bitcoin but Bitcoin outperforms in the upcycles because there’s a network Adoption model which is why it does so much better than almost all other assets so that’s the everything code is the fact that it’s all down to one simple thing and I think it’s forecastable and in which case we know the price of Assets in advance which is a little bit Freaky and I know that sounds somewhat arrogant but it’s a hypothesis that I’ll test but I’m pretty sure it’s going to be right unless something changes realvision founder and CEO Raul Paul has condensed his over 20 years of investment and macroeconomic experience into a single overarching investment hypothesis he has coined the everything Code in his latest macro update on cryptocurrency AI and the economy Raul breaks down his view of finance and investing into its simplest form money in and money out Raul argues that the world very clearly runs on interest rate Cycles which last roughly three and a Half to four years and involve a cycle of increasing interest rates and monetary tightening followed by a pause and then cutting interest rates and further monetary stimulus Raul using his every everything code believes that we have just come out of the bottom of a liquidity cycle and More Cowbell IE Stimulus is on the way he argues that the best assets to invest in at these points are exponential assets that have adoption effects namely cryptocurrency and technology stocks by examining past Market cycles and using his Global liquidity index Raul predicts that Bitcoin ethereum and crypto in general will continue to outperform other assets Due to its more exponential and network adoption model make sure to stick around to the end of the video where role goes as far to suggest that the price of assets can be forecasted out 18 months in advance which he plans to test also only a small percentage of my viewers Are actually subscribed if you enjoy Finance content consider subscribing or liking the video it’s free and you can always change your mind I’ll start with everything code because that’s where we are today and a bit into the future the exponential age is where we’re all going the way to calculate GDP is population Growth plus productivity growth Plus growth those are the three large factors that Define how GDP moves The Wealth of Nations we have for a long time and it’s been the observable macro trend of my lifetime or my working career is that we have been in a slow down in population growth globally So an aging demographic so that has meant we have seen lowering GDP over time Trend rate of GDP has been falling for the earlier part of that Trend so we’re talking about the 80s 90s and early 2000s answer to that was increasing debt growth and hoping that a Productivity miracle was going to come along even though we had the Advent of the computer the internet mobile phone everything in that period of time we actually didn’t increase productivity per capita and that’s more of a function of Aging demographics so demographics is the big secular issue that Society faces Now over that period of time going back a little bit further sorry there’s quite a lot of moving Parts here but going back further that baby boom Generation all came into the labor force at the same time it caused the inflation of the 70s as you put the largest bulge in Population in all recorded history into the workforce and into the consumption Force at the same time they went out and bid for the first housing first cars first everything else we had some Supply shocks and before you know it we had structural inflation but another thing happened is that they came into the Labor force when you put 76 million people all of the same age in the labor force they compete with each other for jobs and real wages never went up again ever and then these people the Baby Boomers had you lot the millennials and they’re both in the labor force at The same time and the millennial population was larger not as a percentage of the overall population but in actual cohort numbers so what you did is You Killed The American Dream you killed the dream of increasing productivity leads to increasing real wages and the answer to that was debt And so debt growth and so that build up in debt offset the inability to buy assets so they basically the balance she ends up working out roughly that households borrowed money to buy assets what happened is that whole system became a debt based system and in 2008 We just had the ceiling just the whole thing blew up and it was the defining moment of our lifetimes what had happened is governments around the world had got to roughly 100 of GDP in debt now if you think about that magic formula that GDP the GDP growth is really what drives savings And Investments and also pays the interest on the debt now because GDP growth had been falling over the last 30 years what you found is Trend rate of GDP since about the early 2000s had fallen to about two percent and interest rates were about two percent well they were a bit higher Beforehand 2007 they were six percent so what happened is there’s not enough money to pay the interest because if you think about it GDP is growing at two percent you need to pay six percent interest rates on the government debt which is a hundred percent but the private sector’s a hundred and something Percent in debt as well so what happened is the whole system broke the answer to that was firstly cut rates to zero everywhere and then it was quantitative easing and it took me a very long time to understand what the hell this is all about we kind of knew that they were Injecting money into the system what did it mean how did it work nobody knew we were arguing about it for a very long time and it was only until really at about 2020 when we saw the next big wave of so we had QE in obviously 2009 10 11 12. then Again I think it was in 14 and then again in 2019 and then a lot more in 2020 and it was observable that asset prices moved every time it happened and the correlation was very tight and we were kind of trying to figure out was this causation correlation none of us really Knew but we could observe it 2020 comes along and it becomes strikingly obvious that there’s a bigger force of play here and I started to realize the force at play here was actually debasement of currency so people have been expecting quantitative easing to be a inflationary Process I.E the cost of goods rise but they don’t the cost of assets Rose because scarce Supply things assets get readjusted in price when you lower the purchasing power of a currency now here we’re not it’s not the dollar versus the Euro versus the Yen we’re talking basically all fiat currency the Value of it because there’s a lot more of it around becomes less and the quantitative easing was the supercharging of this process so that was basically was the defining factor of asset prices and if you back it out and we look at a global macro investor my Research service we look at the G5 central bank balance sheets plus and two for those countries and we find there’s a 97 and a half percent correlation between the s p and that it’s like okay so what we’re doing is is debasing currency That’s the basis of the problem We now face then let’s look at things in those terms so I started dividing the s p by the FED balance sheet or the G4 central bank balance sheets and all assets and what you got was kind of a normalized world where the s p had gone nowhere really gold had gone nowhere Real estate had gone nowhere but two assets have gone up a lot and one was technology and the other was crypto that’s when I started to understand Network effects and understand the secular trends that drive cryptocurrencies and many Technologies and that was the whole thesis I started building about Metcalf’s law and understanding that out of that whole moment as well I started focusing on the technology side of the equation and I could see clearly when I looked at the data long enough and divided by the balance sheet it looked at various ways there was something Actually much bigger going on so then I started digging in and I came up with this thesis of the exponential age which I’ll come back to which was I realized we’re walking into a Nexus of network adoption effects at scale of which Humanities never seen before of numerous Technologies and we’ll talk about that okay so that was that thesis this is what gave me a lot of the strength to understand what to do in crypto I realized that crypto was a secular Trend driven by Network adoption and a cyclical Trend driven by liquidity I the balance sheets M2 those Kind of things if you lean into those you get the big opportunity my way of doing that was not by trading in and out of crypto it was just by adding when it all pukes and everything goes horribly wrong and you’re the bottom of the long-term adoption Trend channel two Standard deviations oversold okay there’s the a perfect Buy Signal if you believe the network adoption continues and that’s worked for every Technology stock from Amazon to Apple to Microsoft to everything they all work the same way it’s like and once you see this stuff you can’t unsee it secular Trends Cyclical Trends the Nexus the magic Nexus is really an amazing opportunity which was last year in crypto and last year in exponential Age Technology and Technology overall what the everything code was was me then starting to dig into a chart that I saw that the ism was Perfectly cyclical every peak in the ism which is my proxy for the business cycle is three and a half years apart since 2008. I looked at that and thought what the hell is going on because we were used to remember that long cycle going into the 2008 you know the great Moderation and now suddenly like clockwork the peak of the ism and then as the ism Falls hey Presto back comes quantitative easing I’m like okay what’s this all about and then I stumbled into something that was quite remarkable is I looked at the increase in the balance sheets The increase in GDP growth anything in excess of GDP growth was being monetized but three and a half years later so then I looked at the debt structure of the United States and realized every single man-woman child Corporation and the government and every government around the world and every corporation reset all interest Rates to zero in 2009. it was like a reset and everybody’s got roughly three to five year debts and they keep rolling every three and a half years and what I found is the interest payments that the US makes and the EU and Japan and the UK were explained by the amount Of concept of eating that happens three and a half years later so what I’d suddenly stumbled across in the everything code was the fact that the global central banks had probably agreed together in 2009 10 11 12 probably 2012 after Europe blew up that with governments of 100 of GDP in debt they were going to crowd out all the private sector and we were just going to keep having Financial crises and the only way of solving this was putting it on the central bank balance sheet because there’s not enough GDP to pay the interest So if you think about GDP growth and let’s make the maths easy even the GDP growth is actually 1.75 average uh sorry Trend rate in the US but let’s call it two percent and let’s assume interest rates are two percent which is roughly where they’ve been since 2008. so if the Government’s 100 GDP in debt GDP grows at two percent and interest payments are two percent that’s all of GDP growth just to pay the US government debt just to pay the interest on the debt so but the private sector excluding the financial sector so households and corporations with another 120 of GDP in Debt but that will give you negative growth every year of two percent and it just compounds so what happens is those interest payments just go into the FED balance and they monetize it so then the private sector is not competing with the government and that was provable across All of the major economies it’s like they’ve all decided that they were too far in debt and the only way of doing this was quantitative easy and then I started thinking well if I know this to be true and I know that the central bank balance sheets are 97 correlated with The asset prices well all I need to do is predict is use forward-looking indicators for the central bank balance sheets or and or interest payments I can back it out a number of ways and what I found is that I could build a model with Julian Bittle who works with me to Forecast out the growth for central bank balance sheet by about 18 months to two years and it works almost perfectly and then I backed it out a number of ways because I don’t want to just rely on one indicator like you know forward-looking indicators I Had been using for a long time the chart of the labor force participation rate in the United States which is a function of demographics and I found that it perfectly correlates with the FED balance sheet and it predicts it going forwards because you know where demographics are going to go Going forwards and it got to this number where the balance sheet gets between 12 and 14 trillion by the end of 2025. now if I know that and I can prove it out by the interest payments that we know are due because we can see that in advance And they come to roughly the same number which is 12 to 14 trillion then I looked at it different ways I looked at the trend rate in a log channel and it would give you the same number at the same period of time which is the next Cyclical peak in the ism so if we look at that and we know that it’s the maiden driver of asset prices we know where asset prices are going which is why it becomes everything code because there is no macro it is all an interest rate cycle driven by Interest payments because all that got reset which is why everybody has struggled since 2008 to understand the world so then when you’re seeking Clarity in this world and the world is actually the most simple it’s ever been money in Money ad that’s it then what you want to do is Earn the assets that rise the most and outperform that which happens to be crypto and technology so if we look at the last time we went through this point which is the turn in the cycle which is where we are today that was December 21st I think it was 2018 when the FED Paused which is roughly where we’re getting to now the market already knows this it can see it coming we’re already having a banking crisis you know all the signs of we need to stop and what happened after that over the next year is the s p Rose about 15 the NASDAQ Rose About 25 what I call the exponential age stocks um they Rose about 35 40 and crypto did well at one point three hundred percent but end of the year up about 100 which is truly extraordinary I’ve also then shown that crypto is all the same thing so if I use the same Global liquidity index it’s basically chart Bitcoin but Bitcoin outperforms in the upcycles because there’s a network adoption model which which is why it does so much better than almost all other assets so that’s the everything code is the fact that it’s all down to one simple thing and I think it’s Forecastable and in which case we know the price of Assets in advance which is a little bit freaky and I know that sounds somewhat arrogant but it’s a hypothesis that I’ll test but I’m pretty sure it’s gonna be right unless something changes source","pubDate":"2023-05-15

Even Bitcoin, the trailblazer of digital currencies, is struggling to surge from its bearish channel, signaling a broader downturn in the market. Amidst this somber backdrop, Cardano (ADA), a prominent , has been flashing an extremely bearish signal. As the ADA price tumbles continuously near $0.36, there is a possibility of a massive sell-off in the next few days. Information from IntoTheBlock reveals that the previous week was a favorable one for Cardano bulls, as indicated by data on large-scale buy and sell transactions. Importantly, the data only considers addresses that have traded a minimum of 1% of the ADA’s multi-million dollar volume. The data shows that hefty bearish sell-offs accounted for 158.6 billion ADA last week. However, substantial bullish activities drove their purchase volume to nearly $160 billion. The number of such addresses is evenly split between sellers and buyers, with a count of 36 each. Despite the seemingly minor difference, it underscores that even with a recent 18% decline in ADA’s price over the last 30 days, a significant amount of capital continues to hold a bullish stance on the Cardano token. The Bid-Ask Volume Imbalance for ADA persists in a bullish state, suggesting a sustained buying momentum. This metric gauges the disparity between the quantity of ADA on the purchasing side versus the selling side of the order book. A positive imbalance indicates a greater demand to purchase ADA over selling it, which could potentially boost the price. is currently hovering at a crucial juncture where significant resistance and support levels intersect. This could potentially trigger a significant price movement in the near future. While the long-term indicators suggest a continued downward trend, the direction of the imminent breakout from this short-term fluctuation, either upward or downward, will be instrumental in forecasting the trajectory of the future trend. As of writing, the ADA price is trading at $0.37, surging over 0.4% in the last 24 hours. Cardano’s ADA token has witnessed a minor Doji candle today, suggesting an intense battle between the bears and bulls. After forming a low near $0.366, the ADA price has successfully rebounded and maintained momentum above the 23.6% Fib level. Analyzing the price chart, it is anticipated that bears may try to send the altcoin’s price near $0.36 to test the market’s patience. If bulls form a bullish channel in the RSI chart near the 42-level, the ADA token can surge above its EMA100 resistance and head toward its next resistance at $0.38-$0.39.","pubDate":"2023-05-15 14:26:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"coinpedia","category":["top"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"VeChain Emerges as a Top 50 Food Traceability Service Provider Worldwide, Spearheading the Blockchain Revolution","link":"https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/vechain-emerges-as-a-top-50-food-traceability-service-provider-worldwide-spearheading-the-blockchain-revolution/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=vechain-emerges-as-a-top-50-food-traceability-service-provider-worldwide-spearheading-the-blockchain-revolution","keywords":["News","Baas","Blockchain","Vechain","VET"],"creator":["Olivia Brooke"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Vechain blockchain has emerged on the list of the Top 50 Food traceability service providers, as it globally transforms food sustainability.

According to a recent Financial Times report, the leading cryptocurrency enforcement agency in the country has announced a crackdown on illegal behavior on digital platforms, claiming that the extent of crypto crime has expanded dramatically in the last four years. The DoJ is targeting crypto exchanges as well as “mixers and tumblers” that conceal the trail of transactions, according to Eun Young, director of the agency’s national cryptocurrency enforcement team (NCET). The Department is also targeting businesses that commit or allow crimes such as money laundering to occur. Choi said: She added that the emphasis on platforms would convey a deterrent message to organizations that are not investing in robust compliance and risk mitigation procedures and are not adhering to anti-money laundering or customer identification rules. Choi continued: The DoJ is reportedly also focusing on thefts and hacks involving decentralized finance (DeFi), notably “chain bridges” where users can trade multiple types of digital tokens or embryonic enterprises with susceptible code. Under the Biden Administration, the crypto enforcement unit under the DoJ has emerged as one of the government agencies with the harshest position on crypto in the world. There are fears in the industry that a tougher assault on companies with systemic importance, such as Binance [BNB], could further destabilize the industry. However, Choi confirmed that if a corporation has gained a considerable market share in part by breaking US criminal law, the Department cannot take action against them.","pubDate":"2023-05-15 14:16:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"cryptosrus","category":["top"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bitcoin’s Bearish Trend Continues: Bulls Await Breakthrough Above $27.2K","link":"https://coinpedia.org/bitcoin/bitcoins-bearish-trend-continues-bulls-await-breakthrough-above-27-2k/","keywords":["Bitcoin","Price Analysis"],"creator":["Elena R"],"video_url":null,"description":"The post Bitcoin’s Bearish Trend Continues: Bulls Await Breakthrough Above $27.2K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a fascinating twist of fate, a seasoned crypto trader who made waves by selling Bitcoin (BTC) at an astounding $30,000 is now revealing his plan to re-enter the market.  Crypto analyst DonAlt in his new video update, is cautiously assessing the current state of affairs.

He recalls a monumental bear trap on March 9th, where BTC broke below the critical support level of $21,000, only to reclaim it a few days later and surge toward the $30,000 mark. Drawing inspiration from this historical event, DonAlt suggests that a similar opportunity may be emerging. BTC recently broke support at $27,200, hitting a low of $26,270 last week. However, DonAlt advises vigilance, awaiting signs of support reclamation before considering re-entry into the market. While bullish sentiments persist, DonAlt warns that Bitcoin remains in a bearish state until it successfully trades above the $27,200 level. For him, a breakdown represents a bearish scenario, and he advocates exercising caution until the market demonstrates strength by reclaiming the critical level. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $27,202, highlighting the delicate balance of the crypto market’s current landscape. The road to reaccumulation is fraught with uncertainty, but DonAlt’s seasoned approach and astute observations continue to captivate traders and investors alike.","pubDate":"2023-05-15 14:13:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"coinpedia","category":["top"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"}]
